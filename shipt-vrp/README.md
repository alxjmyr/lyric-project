* TODO
    * Figure out splitting demand to individual nodes then recombining once routes are created so that implementation actually mimics what we do at Shipt
    * Speak to Differences from core S&D Problem
        * implement 2 order constraint
        * implement time horizon component
    * good visualization of problem (I think this is mostly done at this point)
        * starting state (Nodes + their deliveries)
        * Final Routes
    * summary & slides
        * Framing up SDD/NDD parcel delivery problem
